This is implementation of permutations algorithm i wrote. 
1) Start ther server.js using node
2)Go to port:3000
3)Enter string in the text box
4)Click on permute
5)You'd be directed to the page that has all the permutations of the entered string


Developed an permutations algorithm few years ago. Now, i've implemented it. 
Front end to take the string to permute. Back end will has the algorithm of permutation. 
It excutes the program. And will send the string of all permutations to the front end for display.


One needs to understand NodeJs, ExpressJs, BodyParser and JavaScript to Understand this code.
